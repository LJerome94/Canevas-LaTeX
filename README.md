# About

This is a simple [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) template for homework assignements, more precisly for mathematics and physics. This was originaly intended [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), but it should also work in any TeX environement you might have locally given you use the right compiler (see below).

# Usage (TODO)

# Credits
Special thanks to:

- David Sénéchal who inspired the page formating.
- Théo Dionne who suggested various LaTeX commands.
